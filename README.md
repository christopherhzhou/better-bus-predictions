# Better MBTA bus predictions

The overarching purpose of my next big project is to make bus arrival predictions that are better
than those made by MBTA's prediction algorithm through the use of data analysis
and machine learning. However, in order to train a machine learning model, you must
first collect data. That is the step that I am working on right now, and is the current focus of
this program.

This program is designed to handle virtually any kind of error that may occur from polling
data from an API, so you could begin running the "record.py" script and it should never
fail or break until you choose to terminate the script.
